spoof fps & stats in flex your fps and ping on roblox
# usage
you need to edit the values within the script first so lets do fps multiplied by 2:
  goto line 44 (["fps"] = v_u_11,)
  change "v_u_11" to "v_u_11*2"
  execute the script and wait ~5 seconds
  should now have doubled fps displayed to everyone else ingame
  you can now do this to all the rest of the values in the script
# also
no ping spoofer since thats handled serversidedly ):
